The Library Management System Application with Database Integration is designed to manage books, users, authors, and genres within a library. It also integrates a MySQL Database to efficiently store data.
The application has a variety of features:
1. Book Operations: The applications allows a user to add, borrow, return, search and display books
2. User Operations: The application allows the user to add new user, view user details and display all users in the database
3. Author Operations: The application allows the user to add a new author, view author details, and display all authors in the database.
4. Genre Operations: The application allows the user to add a new genre, view genre details, and display all genres in the database.
After the Database is created using SQL and the connection is made, execute the file, "main.py" to start the application.
Once the application is run, the main menu will come up which provides a very user friendly menu for deciding which action they would like to take. From the main menu, the application is almost self explanatory for the user.
The application also contains basic error handling which will handle invalid input and database-related errors.
